This code uses the ncurses library to create a simple ping pong game. The paddles are controlled by the 'w' and 's' keys for player 1, and the 'i' and 'k' keys for player 2. Press 'q' to quit the game.

The game loop handles the movement of the paddles, the ball, and checks for collisions. The screen is updated and refreshed using the ncurses functions.

To compile and run this code, you will need to install the ncurses library and compile with the "-lncurses" flag. For example, you can use the following command:

gcc ping_pong.c -o ping_pong -lncurses


./ping_pong


Please note that the performance and visuals of the game might vary depending on the terminal you are using.
